/**  
  SCSS allows us to specify partials. Partials are files written in scss but will not be transpilled to css directly.
  They are usually imported into another scss file which gets transpilled.
  The concept of partials is a way to help modularize css code and enhance maintainability of them.
  
  When importing partials into a file, the order of import matters. Based on CSS cascading behaviour, if there are
  two conflicting styles defined in the imported partials, the latest one takes precedence.

  If there is a variable in any of the partials which other partials depend on, then the partial holding the variables need to be imported first.
  A partial is denoted by an underscore (_), before it's name.
